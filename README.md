ECON 21410: Computational Methods in Economics
==============================================

# Syllabus

[The class syllabus can be found here.](https://github.com/jmbejara/comp-econ-sp18/blob/master/Syllabus-Computational-Economics.pdf)

# Notes

There should be about 19 classes and 9 TA sessions (first Monday excluded). This means that we have 28 in-class sessions total before the reading period.

* Read the lectures ahead of time. The lectures (from, e.g., QuantEcon or the Python Data Science Handbook) have hyperlinks to the appropriate text.

**Books Used**

* [Lectures in ](https://lectures.quantecon.org/)[Quantitative Economics](https://lectures.quantecon.org/), by Thomas J. Sargent and John Stachurski (QuantEcon)

* [Python for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book), by Wes McKinney (PDA)

**Assignments**

* Assignments must be turned in before midnight on the day that they are due. This means that you must submit your pull request on GitHub before midnight. Late assignments will not be accepted.
