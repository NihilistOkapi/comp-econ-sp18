# HW Example

This is an example of what an assignment will look like. The assignment
will be described in the README file in the appropriate folder, or
the README will provide a link to a PDF with the assignment description.
The folder will also contain relevant data or other files needed for
completing the assignment. 


# Problem 1

Write a Python function that will compute the `n`-th number
in the sequence of Fibonacci numbers. Save the file in a `.py` file.


# Problem 2

Create a Jupyter notebook (in Python) that plots the Sine function
from 0 to 2 pi.
